TypeScript Project
Description
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on building a deeper understanding of TypeScript through various tasks. The project aims to teach the foundations of TypeScript, such as working with interfaces, classes, functions, and generic types.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Understand and use basic types in TypeScript.
Work with interfaces, classes, and functions in TypeScript.
Manipulate the DOM with TypeScript.
Utilize generic types and namespaces.
Implement declaration merging and ambient namespaces to import external libraries.
Apply basic nominal typing in TypeScript.
Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
All files should end with a new line.
The project will be transpiled on Ubuntu 18.04.
Jest will be used for testing (version 24.9.*).
A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
TypeScript scripts should use the .ts extension.
No TypeScript compilation errors or warnings should occur when running the project.
Project Structure
The project is divided into multiple tasks, each with a specific goal to demonstrate various TypeScript features.

Creating an interface for a student: You will create an interface and render a table with student data.
Building a Teacher interface: Learn to create more complex interfaces and extend them with additional attributes.
Extending the Teacher class: Explore inheritance by extending interfaces.
Printing teachers: Implement functions that manipulate names.
Writing a class: Create classes with constructors and methods.
Advanced types Part 1: Work with interfaces and implement a system to differentiate between teachers and directors.
Creating functions specific to employees: Define type predicates and execute different tasks based on employee type.
String literal types: Create literal types and explore their usage in functions.
Ambient Namespaces: Learn to integrate third-party libraries with TypeScript.
Namespace & Declaration merging: Implement declaration merging using namespaces and interface extension.
Brand convention & Nominal typing: Create and manage unique types for credits using nominal typing.
Tasks Breakdown
Each task has specific instructions and examples provided in the project folder. You'll start by copying the necessary configuration files (such as package.json, .eslintrc.js, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js) into each task folder, and then implement the required TypeScript functionality in the respective files.
